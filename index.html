<!--                    <h3>Bio</h3>-->
                    <p>Hello! My name is Hudson Wilk and with the help of my lifelong friend, Logan Mabry, we founded East Dallas Athletics Camp (EDAC). Growing up in East Dallas, I went through the feeder pattern of Mockingbird Elementary, William B. Travis, and Woodrow Wilson HS. My time in this pattern was one that I wouldn't trade for the world and I couldn’t imagine a better upbringing to make me the person I am today. I currently attend the University of Texas at Austin and I am majoring in Advertising/ Business Marketing. During my time at Woodrow Wilson, I was Varsity Captain of the Baseball team, an International Baccalaureate Diploma recipient, and a 4-year Member of the National Honor Society.</p>
                    <p>Over the past few summers, I worked at various camps and was inspired by the concept of a kids sports camp. This inspiration gave way to the idea to start my own camp with my dear friend Logan. After conducting several weeks of successful camp fun, a spark was lit, and I knew this was just the beginning. My main goal in co-founding EDAC was to provide an unforgettable experience to the younger generation that I was so lucky to have growing up in East Dallas and regularly attending various summer camps. We want to not only provide a safe and enjoyable environment during the long summer months but also serve as mentors for kids, helping them develop through a fun and inclusive process.</p>

                    <p>Hey there! My name is Logan Mabry and I’m a co-founder of East Dallas Athletic Camp (EDAC), with the courteous help of my best friend, Hudson Wilk. I currently attend Colorado State University in Fort Collins majoring in Finance, and prior I attended the feeder pattern of Mockingbird, J.L Long, and Woodrow. I was one of Woodrow’s Varsity Basketball Captains, an active member of the National Honor Society for two years, and a former Lifeguard at Tietze Pool. I graduated with High Honors and look to continue the same throughout my time in college.</p>
                    <p>Growing up, sports camps always were a huge factor in my life, and something I will forever cherish. The idea of starting our very own sports camp came about last summer, and Hudson and I knew we’d have a great opportunity to give back to the place that we’ve always loved. The main driving point for why I decided to be a part of founding EDAC was to give back to the community of East Dallas and allow for summer fun for the kids, and free time for busy working parents. I remember growing up and being sent off to various summer sport camps as a kid, and they were always my favorite part about summer. My goal with this camp is to not only help out the future generations of the East Dallas vicinity with summer fun, but to give them a wonderful time to learn, grow, and develop their skills for the future. We want to provide these kids with life long memories and opportunities that will make an everlasting impact.</p>

                <p>“One of the highlights of my 10-year-old son's year was spending 4 days at camp with Logan and Hudson. Not only did he build a little more stamina and endurance, he gained confidence. You can easily see the leadership each of the coaches brings to the table. My son had no complaints and that's a first lol.”</p>
