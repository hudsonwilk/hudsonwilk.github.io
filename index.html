                    <p>Hello! My name is Hudson Wilk and with the help of my lifelong friend, Logan Mabry, we founded East Dallas Athletics Camp (EDAC). Growing up in East Dallas, I went through the feeder pattern of Mockingbird Elementary, William B. Travis, and Woodrow Wilson HS. My time in this pattern was one that I wouldn't trade for the world and I couldn’t imagine a better upbringing to make me the person I am today. I currently attend the University of Texas at Austin and I am majoring in Advertising/ Business Marketing. During my time at Woodrow Wilson, I was Varsity Captain of the Baseball team, an International Baccalaureate Diploma recipient, and a 4-year Member of the National Honor Society.</p>
                    <p>Over the past few summers, I worked at various camps and was inspired by the concept of a kids sports camp. This inspiration gave way to the idea to start my own camp with my dear friend Logan. After conducting several weeks of successful camp fun, a spark was lit, and I knew this was just the beginning. My main goal in co-founding EDAC was to provide an unforgettable experience to the younger generation that I was so lucky to have growing up in East Dallas and regularly attending various summer camps. We want to not only provide a safe and enjoyable environment during the long summer months but also serve as mentors for kids, helping them develop through a fun and inclusive process.</p>

                    <p>Hey there! My name is Logan Mabry and I’m a co-founder of East Dallas Athletic Camp (EDAC), with the courteous help of my best friend, Hudson Wilk. I currently attend Colorado State University in Fort Collins majoring in Finance, and prior I attended the feeder pattern of Mockingbird, J.L Long, and Woodrow. I was one of Woodrow’s Varsity Basketball Captains, an active member of the National Honor Society for two years, and a former Lifeguard at Tietze Pool. I graduated with High Honors and look to continue the same throughout my time in college.</p>
                    <p>Growing up, sports camps always were a huge factor in my life, and something I will forever cherish. The idea of starting our very own sports camp came about last summer, and Hudson and I knew we’d have a great opportunity to give back to the place that we’ve always loved. The main driving point for why I decided to be a part of founding EDAC was to give back to the community of East Dallas and allow for summer fun for the kids, and free time for busy working parents. I remember growing up and being sent off to various summer sport camps as a kid, and they were always my favorite part about summer. My goal with this camp is to not only help out the future generations of the East Dallas vicinity with summer fun, but to give them a wonderful time to learn, grow, and develop their skills for the future. We want to provide these kids with life long memories and opportunities that will make an everlasting impact.</p>

I graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School as an International Baccalaureate Diploma recipient and now attend the University of Tennessee, where I’m studying in the nursing program. Sports have always been a huge part of my life. I was a four-year varsity starter and captain of the Lady Wildcats soccer team, helping lead our team to many great wins. I also have plenty of experience working with kids—I’ve been an assistant coach for the Lakewood Lions, a second-grade girls’ YMCA soccer team, and I’ve spent several years working as a lifeguard. I’m passionate about helping young athletes grow their skills and confidence, and I can’t wait to have a fun and inspiring summer with everyone at camp!</p>

I’ve lived in East Dallas my entire life, and growing up in this amazing community has shaped who I am today. I attended Hexter Elementary, J.L. Long Middle School, and graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in 2024. I was a competitive gymnast at Ridgewood Gymnastics, competing at Level 9. At Woodrow, I ran track all four years, played golf during my sophomore year, participated in two musicals, and served as varsity cheer captain. I’m currently attending the University of Texas, majoring in Education because of my passion for teaching and mentoring kids. I’ve had lots of experience working with children—from babysitting to teaching at Incarnation Academy’s summer program last year. I can’t wait to help make this summer a fun, positive, and empowering experience for all the young athletes at camp!</p>

                        <p><strong>Matthew Casas</strong><br>Hey there! My name is Matthew Casas, and I’m so excited for this year’s camp to kick off! I’m a proud graduate of Woodrow Wilson High School, where I played boys’ volleyball, club volleyball, and basketball. I’m now heading into my sophomore year at the University of Texas, majoring in Advertising and Communication. Camps have always been a big part of my life—my dad managed Ridgewood Recreation Center and ran the summer camp there, so I grew up learning what it takes to create a fun and safe environment for kids. That experience has really shaped the kind of camp counselor I strive to be. Before joining EDAC, I worked as a lifeguard for the City of Dallas for three years, and I’m currently CPR certified through the American Red Cross. I’m really looking forward to making a positive impact and helping your kids have an unforgettable camp experience!</p>

                        <p><strong>Zach Lewis</strong><br>Hi! My name is Zach Lewis and I am extremely excited to be a part of the staff for the East Dallas Athletics Camp this summer! I’ve lived in the Lakewood area my whole life. I attended Lakewood Elementary and graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School. During high school at Woodrow, I played varsity baseball, and sports in general were a huge part of my life. Currently, I attend the University of Arkansas, majoring in Finance. I have always had a passion for working with kids, as I feel I can get on their level and understand their emotions really well. I also have a ton of experience with kids, including being a co-founder of the Kickoff Sports Dallas nonprofit organization, where we hosted sports summer camps often. I am also a lifeguard at the Tietze Park Pool. I’m truly looking forward to having an amazing summer with these young athletes and helping them grow not only athletically, but as people too!!</p>

I’ve lived in East Dallas my whole life and have loved connecting with the community through babysitting and spending time with local families. I attended Woodrow Wilson High School, where I was involved in several clubs and played on the tennis team my junior year. I’m now at Colorado State University in the Honors Program, studying Fine Arts and Merchandising/Marketing. Sports, and especially sports camps, have been a huge part of my life since I was little. I grew up attending gymnastics, basketball, and tennis camps with friends and family, and I have so many great memories. I’m passionate about working with kids and helping them realize how strong, capable, and confident they truly are. I can’t wait to be a positive role model, make new memories, and have an awesome summer together!</p>

                <p>“One of the highlights of my 10-year-old son's year was spending 4 days at camp with Logan and Hudson. Not only did he build a little more stamina and endurance, he gained confidence. You can easily see the leadership each of the coaches brings to the table. My son had no complaints and that's a first lol.”</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>This is EDAC's second year running, led by Hudson and Logan, who both have extensive experience working with kids in various camp and activity settings. Before starting their own camp, Hudson worked as a counselor at Friends of Lakewood (FOL), an assistant at Woodrow Baseball Camp, and a counselor for Studio Bella at White Rock United Methodist Church. Logan also has a strong background in working with kids—he is a CPR-certified lifeguard and has worked at Woodrow Basketball Camps. Additionally, both have dedicated many hours to volunteering in local schools through the Young Men’s Service League (YMSL), a community service organization.</p>

                        <p>Campers must bring a refillable water bottle (we’ll have refill stations available), their own lunch in a secure lunchbox, and athletic clothing with closed-toe shoes. A healthy snack will be provided daily.</p>

                        <p>There will be no religious practices that take place during our camp. While we hold camp at a church for its convenient space and resources, our program is entirely secular.
